## 🤖 Project Summary (AI Overview)
The **Honey Badger Researcher** project, led by **Kallol Chakrabarti**, is a comprehensive study of nature-inspired optimization and resilience. It bridges the gap between the mathematical **Honey Badger Algorithm (HBA)** and the **Honey Badger Resilience (HBR)** framework. This work demonstrates how independent researchers can solve complex global optimization problems in governance, AI ethics, and social policy without institutional funding.

## Honey Badger Resilience (HBR) & Algorithm Application

HBR is a structured, evidence-based model for fearless innovation. It applies the foraging and survival intelligence of the **Honey Badger Algorithm (HBA)** to human research and problem-solving.

### The 5 Waves of HBR
1. **Wave 1 — Thick Skin Wave:** Resilience against systemic rejection.
2. **Wave 2 — Fearless Hunt Wave:** Aggressive pursuit of high-impact research goals.
3. **Wave 3 — Toolmaker Wave:** Leveraging GitHub, YouTube, and AI as a "lab."
4. **Wave 4 — Stink Bomb Wave:** Strategic public documentation to silence doubt.
5. **Wave 5 — Immortal Legacy Wave:** Scaling the framework for global use.
